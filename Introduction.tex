\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

The purpose of this assignment was to partly model and simulate a continuous system influenced by stochastic signals. To do this we had to use basic identification techniques on parameters that were not specifically given, use basic control theory to design a simple autopilot to control the system and implement a discrete Kalman filter for wave filtering and estimation of disturbances by using both Matlab and Simulink.

This report is organized as follows: \Cref{sec:part1} contains the identification of the boat parameters, \cref{sec:part2} the identification of the wave spectrum model where we found the estimate PSD function and analytic PSD for $\psi_w$, plus an analytic expression of the transfer function of the wave response model. \Cref{sec:part3} contains the control system design where we designed an autopilot for the ship, such that it would be able to follow a desired course. \Cref{sec:part4} we calculate the observability matrices for different variations of the system and in \cref{sec:part5} we implemented a discrete Kalman filter to estimate the bias, the heading and the high-frequency wave induced motion on the heading. In addition to this the Appendix contains the Matlab code, Simulink diagrams and the plots.
